### Product Name: Echo Locate

When it comes to location finding and tracking, GPS is an ubiquitous technology; however, it is only accurate and relevant for use outdoors. Due to the close proximity of different rooms and different floors, the complexities of buildings are far too great for GPS to retrieve a precise location. Thus, there is great need across multiple industries for location services to function inside multi-floor buildings with many rooms.

To effectively monitor indoor location, _Echo Locate_ implements various wireless communication protocols (RFID, BLE, etc.) and wearable devices, allowing for room to room and floor to floor accuracy.

The primary beneficiaries of _Echo Locate_ are retirement homes and psychiatric wards where awareness of room-specific patient location is essential. However the capabilities of _Echo Locate_ can also be extended to other industries such as education, shipping, manufacturing, and security. For example, a manufacturing facility can tag each product, and monitor its progress as it is moving through the assembly process. Similarly, the shipping industry can utilize this technology to ensure that the packages have reached intermediate destinations as well as the final recipient, all without the constant oversight of employees.

As a system, _Echo Locate_ features multiple wireless technologies and trilateration techniques to determine patient location within a five foot radius horizontally and vertically. This level of accuracy translates to a location precise enough to determine patient location room to room and floor to floor. Given the system utilizes wearable devices, _Echo Locate_ has a battery lifetime of longer than one year, requiring little maintenance from the users. Finally the system culminates in a graphical user interface through which the users can see patientsâ€™ current locations, as well as update patient information and restrictions.
